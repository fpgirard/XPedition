# Printing & Installing these STL & STEP Files

##The Kickstand Top Plate (KTP) 
KTP uses a stainless M10x65mm bolt, two stainless washers (flat & lock) and a stainless nylock nut. If you luckily own one of the new XPeditions equipped with a top plate, don't purchase the KTP but invest instead in the LT kickstand and buy the bolt/washers/nut combo above.

For installing the KTP with the existing kickstand, the order of installation - starting from the top is: bolt, lock washer, flat washer, KTP, lower plate, kickstand. You don't need the stainless nylock nut. Watch Sadie [install the KTP on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NQnBHuYv_I).

For installing the KTP with the Haul LT kickstand, the order of installation - starting from the top is: nylock nut, lock washer, KTP, lower plate, kickstand, bolt. You won't need the flat washer. The bolt is inverted so you can easily tighten the nut on top of the KTP. We've learned that no matter how much you tighten this bolt, the LT stand will still rotate in its groove. This should not impact its use nor should it worry you. Some folks have even drilled second holes to accommodate the LT stand but I think this weakens the plates. Sadie also made a YouTube video about the LT sturdiness with [2 kids willing to risk their lives](https://youtu.be/AGip-o0RFSE?si=lpv4pdpWzEscbK1a) - I hope this helps!

## Modifiable Feet for LT kickstan
* Remove the original feet - the best way is to put the bike up on its stand and use a wood block to raise one side.  Using another wood block and hammer to tap off the plastic foot/cap
* Insert the new foot and make sure it’s fully pushed in.  Drill a 5/32 hole through the foot’s hole as a pilot hole
* Remove the foot and widen the 5/32 hole with a 13/64 drill - this hole is used to keep the foot in place
* Re-install foot and install M5 bolt.
